&lt;b&gt;Adds a new self launching pod.&lt;/b&gt;
This pod does not need its own launcher, has a fuel tank and can take off from anywhere !
Useful to travel to a nearby village trade and come back quick.

&lt;b&gt;Also allows you to reuse vanilla pods.&lt;/b&gt;
Target your pods within 20 tiles of a Pod Launcher. 
One pod launcher is required for every arriving pods. Remaining pods drop elsewhere nearby and vanish.

The beacon has been removed in the A17 version.
